# PacParadiseOptimisation

## Senario
As the employee of an operations research consulting company, you are tasked with communicating with a client to develop a mathematical formulation for a nation-wide vaccine distribution strategy.  The nation wishes to evalutate the most cost effective way to transport vaccinations across their country given their current distribution costs and constraints.  Through constant communication with the client to assess their needs, the Python code represents iterations of the optimisation code.

## The Problem
Vaccines are imported into the country through three depots (IDs) and are then transported to a vaccination centre (LVCs).  Citizens from each district (CCD) will be assigned a clininc to receive their vaccination from.

## The Data
The data is comprised of tables containing:
* Distances between each ID to each LVC
* Population of each CCD and distances to the nearest accessible LVCs
* Importation costs per dose of vaccine at each ID
